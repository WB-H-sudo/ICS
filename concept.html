                <h2>Anonymity of a Key Encapsulation Mechanism (KEM)</h2>
                <p>Anonymity of a KEM is defined by analyzing the randomness of the ciphertext distribution. It ensures that the encapsulated ciphertexts do not reveal any information about the underlying data. Specifically, if the ciphertext distribution obtained by the encapsulation function of the KEM scheme is computationally indistinguishable from the uniform ciphertext distribution, it satisfies the anonymity property.</p>
                <p class="quote">"If the ciphertext distribution obtained by the encapsulation function of the KEM scheme is computationally indistinguishable from the uniform ciphertext distribution, it satisfies the anonymity property." [1, 2]</p>
                <p>This means that an adversary should not be able to distinguish between different ciphertexts produced by the encapsulation function, even if they are aware of some parts of the scheme. The more indistinguishable the ciphertext distribution is from random noise, the stronger the anonymity property of the KEM.</p>

                <h2>Indistinguishability</h2>
                <p>Indistinguishability is a concept used in cryptography to describe the situation where two distributions, objects, or events cannot be distinguished by an adversary. In the context of cryptographic protocols, it often refers to the inability of an attacker to distinguish between two different scenarios, distributions, or keys with significant probability.</p>
                <p class="quote">"If no efficient algorithm can distinguish between two distributions or events with a probability significantly greater than random guessing, those distributions or events are considered indistinguishable."</p>
                <p>In KEMs, indistinguishability is important for ensuring the security of the system. It ensures that an adversary cannot distinguish between different public keys, ciphertexts, or encryption outcomes, which is critical for preventing attacks such as chosen ciphertext attacks or key-recovery attacks.</p>
